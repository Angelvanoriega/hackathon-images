# SIIM hackathon-images
Collection of DICOM image to compliment [SIIM's Hackathon FHIR Dataset](https://github.com/ImagingInformatics/hackathon-dataset), the images help coraborate each patient's story.

# Organization
Contains DICOM images (aka part 10 files) under each patient's name, nested below are folders representing the individual studies.

These files can easily be pushed in a DICOM server, e.g. Orthanc or dcm4chee, using multiple methods, one of which is the dcm4che library (not to be confused with the dcm4che*e* server).
